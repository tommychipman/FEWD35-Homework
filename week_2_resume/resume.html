		<h2>Resume</h2>
		<p>
			I recently graduated from a Web Development course at GA where I increased my typing speed from 10 words per minute on my type wirter to 100 on my new MacBook Pro. They also taught me how to be an awesome Web Developer. During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, and spending time with my great grand children.
